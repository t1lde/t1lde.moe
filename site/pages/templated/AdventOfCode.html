<h1>Overengineering Advent of Code 2020 </h1>

<p> I made an attempt at completing Advent of Code 2020 in Haskell, and burned myself out a little bit in the process by overthinking 
and overengineering some of the solutions. I don't reccommend this.
Most of the solutions ended up pretty simple.  </p>

<p> For <a href="/AOC2020/Day4.html">Day 4</a> I had a particularly fun solution where I built a parser from a type-level regex. </p>
