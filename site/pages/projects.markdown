## Complete Project Pages:

- [##Advent of Code 2020](/AOC2020/AdventOfCode.html)


## WIP:
- ## Website Hakyll source code and utilities:

  I've ended up hacking on this site in a monorepo containing several Stack sub-packages for WIP projects/pages... 
  Before I publish this site's source, I'd like to clean up the project a little first.
  
## Other things to check out:
- ## Github/lab
  You can find some other thing's I've worked on my public [Github](https://github.com/t1lde) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/t1lde) respectively.
